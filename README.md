#Week 1
- I learned about logic and proofs.
- The problem about Mel and Vin successfully confused me but I was able to understand it in the end.
- I learned about the definition of propositions and all the logical connectives.

#Week 2
- I learned about the different types of logical equivalences.
- The Universal and Existential Quatifiers were discussed.
- The rules of inference were intriduced to us during this week.

#Week 3
- I encountered the terms converse, inverse, and tautology
- The different methods of proof were discussed such as direct, contraposition, vacuous, trivial, and contradiction
- I need more time to study them because I find them all very confusing.

#Week 4
- Proof by equivalence was taught. 
- Mathematical induction was discussed further. Although we took this up in ENGALG2, it was explained well.

#Week 5
- I was absent on the first day due to heavy traffic. I have to catch up and copy notes.
